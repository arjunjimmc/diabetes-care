Project Name: Diabetes Care Reminder App with Reward & Recovery System Objective: Build a patient-friendly diabetes reminder application that helps users follow daily health routines through reminders, positive reinforcement, and recovery mechanisms. The app must encourage consistency without guilt, pressure, or medical claims. Core User A diabetic person who needs: Simple reminders for medicine, water, meals, sugar checks, exercise Minimal effort interactions Motivation through appreciation and points Flexibility when busy No judgment or fear-based messaging User Onboarding Flow On first use, collect the following information: Basic Details Name Age Gender Diabetes Information Diabetes type (Type 1, Type 2, Gestational, Prediabetes) Date of first diagnosis Latest HbA1c value Latest random blood sugar value Health Context Comorbidities (hypertension, thyroid, heart disease, kidney issues, none) Current medications (optional) Store this data for personalization only. Do not provide diagnosis or medical advice. Reminder Creation Allow users to create reminders in the simplest possible way: Select reminder type (medicine, water, food, sugar check, exercise, insulin, custom) Enter time Set repeat (daily or selected days) No complex configuration screens. Reminder Interaction Logic When a reminder triggers, show three actions clearly: “Yes, I am going to do now” “I am busy, remind me after 5 minutes” “Skip” Action Handling Rules 1. Yes, I am going to do now Mark reminder as In Progress After a short confirmation window, ask: “Have you completed this?” If completed: Mark as Completed Award points Maintain streak 2. I am busy, remind me after 5 minutes Snooze reminder for 5 minutes On reappearance: Increase urgency visually Ask completion again If completed after snooze: Award slightly reduced points 3. Skip Mark reminder as Skipped Deduct points Break daily streak Trigger recovery option Points & Reward System Implement a central points engine: Completed on time: +10 points Completed after snooze: +7 points Skipped: −5 points Points are cumulative and visible to the user. Recovery Mechanism (“I Promise I Will Follow”) After a skip, offer a recovery option: Show a supportive message Allow user to activate recovery mode Recovery Rules User must complete the next 3 reminders without skipping If successful: Restore deducted points Show appreciation message If failed: Recovery expires silently No punishment beyond the original deduction. Streak Logic Completing all reminders in a day increases streak Skipping breaks streak Streak only affects bonus rewards, not base points Appreciation System Show encouraging, non-medical messages such as: “Good job staying consistent today.” “You are taking care of your health.” “Every small step matters.” Never use fear, warnings, or guilt-based language. Daily Summary Provide a daily overview: Total reminders Completed vs skipped Points earned Current streak Tone must always be supportive.
